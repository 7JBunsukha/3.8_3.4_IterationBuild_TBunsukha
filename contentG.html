						<p>The archaic Greek period (c. 800-479BCE) was a period of Greek history where Greece saw multiple changes in language, society, arts, architecture, and politics. This period of Greek history came after the much lesser known and mysterious dark ages of Greece, the archaic Greek period is believed to have started when Homer first wrote the Iliad and the odyssey and ended with the defeat of the Persian army at Plataea in 479BCE. This period of Greek history the most well known as it encompass historically important and well known events such as the first Olympic games in 776BCE, the founding of democracy. The most well known event in all of the archaic Greek period is the Persian Wars when Persian invaded Greek with the intent of conquest, many battles of the wars were recorded and legends still talked about, such battles include the battle of marathon (490BCE), the battle of Thermopoylae (480BCE), Battle of Salamis (480BCE), and the battle of Plataea (479BCE). As the Greek army marched to Plataea to meet the Persian army, at the same time the Athenian fleet sailed to Samos where the Persian fleet beached their ship to prepare for the arrival of the Greeks. When the Athenian reached Samos the battle of Mycale occurred where the Greek decisively ended the Persian War and went on the offensive against the Persians. Alleged the Delian League, an association of Greek poleis (city states), signed the peace of Callias treaty which ended the Persian Wars.

						<p>The classical age of Greece is believed to have began after the Persian defeat at Plataea and Mycale but some believed that this period actually began during the Persian war rather than after it. Although the period is known as Classical Greece, it mainly focuses on the growth of Athens and the Delian League. With the end of the Persian Wars, the Greeks focuses on their internal affairs especially Athens who, using the funds of the Delian League, built the Parthenon and protective walls to their harbour of Piraeus. In this period, Athens saw a political and cultural dominance over Greece and created the Delian League to protect Greek territories from any Persian interference. The Delian League was founded in 478BCE, although it was a coalition of different poleis (city states), Athens was clearly in charge of this league so most tributes and funds from the city states went to Athens, making Athens a powerful and wealthy imperial power. Around 460BCE, the Athenian general Pericles, consolidated his authority over Athens and with the murder of Ephialtes and absent of Cimon, became the ruler of Athens. Pericles used the funds the build the Parthenon on the Acropolis and extended a network of Athenian settlements to further consolidate Athens' authority and establish an Athenian Empire. Pericles used fund to rebuild many buildings that were destroyed in the Persian Wars as well as addition temples to the Greek pantheon, he further spent money on Athenian arts and architecture to show all of Greece that the Athenian way, was the best way to the future. Athens saw many cultural achievements but this did not mean political stability, an with the Athenian empire growing, many city states became wary of Athens, especially Sparta. It was inevitable that then, that war would come to Athens. Sparta and their allies fought Athens and their ally but after many years and battles, the Spartan came out the victor. With the conclusion of the Peloponnesian War, Athens lost their political influence and their cultural advancements declined which would in disorder allowing Philip of Macedon and his son to conquer Greece.</p>
