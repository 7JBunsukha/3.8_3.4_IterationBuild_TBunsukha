						<p style="text-align: center;">The ancient Greeks werenâ€™t united as one people but rather divided by their respective city states, each city state (or polis) had their own laws, government, and distinct dialects. These city states would frequently be at war with one another with the largest war, the Peloponnesian war, ending the classical age of Greece (or Athens). The ancient Greek period (including the classical age of Athens) lasted from the 8th century BCE to 146 BCE when Greece was conquered. The ancient Greeks left behind many things that still lasts to today, from their unique form of government, to their legends and myths.</p>
