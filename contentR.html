						<p>The Roman Republic (Latin: Res publica Romana) was a period in classical antiquity in which Rome was ruled by a republican government, this period lasted from 509BCE to 27BCE. Before Rome was a republic it was a kingdom ruled by a monarchy, there is little information from this period of Roman history. The Republic began with the overthrowing of the Roman monarchy in 509BCE and replaced by a republican government established by Rome's wealthiest citizens, and ended with establishment of the empire. The Roman republic period saw many great events such as Hannibal's legendary crossing of the Alps to Rome and Julius Caesar's murder by the senate. Despite having a republican government where, in theory, all citizens are equal, the early Roman republic, only the wealthy patrician class could hold office in the senate therefore the plebeians, the lower class, established other legislative bodies such as the Council of Plebs (Latin: Consillium Plebis). As Rome became a republic, Rome grew stronger with the senate working with other government bodies to appoint leaders, enact laws, and increasig Rome's influence over the Italian peninsula. Slowly, the Romans began to eliminating other neighbouring civilisation further increasing their superiority over Italy and later the Mediterranean. This period of Roman history saw the Roman republic become the dominant power over the Mediterranean area after defeating the Carthaginian and razing the ancient city Carthage. There were also many famous individual still spoken of today, such figures includes the military dictator Gaius Juluis Caesar who famously cross the Rubicon river to Rome with his legion armed, and the philosopher Cicero who attempted to uphold the Republic and stop Rome from regressing back to monarchical rule.</p>

						<p>Out of all the periods of Classical antiquity, the Roman Empire (Latin: Imperium Romanum) is by far the most widely known. This part of Rome's history saw both famous and infamous individuals. Many architectural wonders and accomplishment were built during this period, such of these wonder includes the Colosseum which was started by Vespasian and finished by his son Titus. Rome became an empire after Julius Caesar great nephew, Octavian, defeated Mark Antony and consolidated his authority over Rome, he was named Augustus by the senate and proclaim emperor. Augustus began the Julio-Claudian dynasty, after Nero, the fifth emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty committed suicide, the empire was is turmoil and the year of the four emperor began. This period saw four individuals fight for the imperial throne with Vespasian coming out on top, he would start the Flavian dynasty and built the most iconic Roman building, the Colosseum. Many dynasty came after with their own famous figures but one of the most famous dynasty is the Nerva-Anotine dynasty. This dynasty saw famous emperors who were named 'the five good emperor' under these emperor Rome was at its height and with the end of the dynasty Rome began to decline. Over many years the Roman emperor began to decline, with Rome itself under threat of invasion and the once proud empire fragmented into separate kingdoms and empire, salvation would come with Emperor Aurelian who reconquered all of Rome territories and earn many names. Rome would continue to prosper until 5 century CE when the proud city of Rome finally fell to the Goths.</p>
